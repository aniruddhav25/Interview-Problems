70. CLIMBING STAIRCASE (Amazon , https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

Problem : CONTIGUOUS SUB-ARRAY SUM : (Google) : 
Given a contiguous array of size n of non-negative integers , find a contiguous sub-array which adds to give sum S.
Time: O(n)
Example : 
array : [1 2 3 7 5]
S : 12
Output : [2, 4]

Problem : 
This problem was asked by Sumo Logic.

Given an unsorted array, in which all elements are distinct, find a "peak" element in O(log N) time.

An element is considered a peak if it is greater than both its left and right neighbors. It is guaranteed that the first and last elements are lower than all others.

Exmaple :
INPUT :

15 20 14 16 48 19 50 60 10 20 30 45 60

OUTPUT :

YES

ALL PEAK ELEMENTS ARE : [20, 48, 60]

Problem : (Google interview) : 
Given two arrays A and B and a targetSum to be achieved , write a function that returns "True" or "False" such that : if a number choosen from A and a number choosen from B has a sum equal to targetSum.

Example:

Input : 
A=> [25 30 41 60 10 -5 60 -2]
B=> [-1 0 20 60]
tragetSum=> -3
Output : 
True

Problem: (Towers and Listeners) This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from 0 (west) to 1000 (east).

Given a list of N listeners, and a list of M radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20], and towers = [4, 8, 15]. In this case the minimum range would be 5, since that would be required for the tower at position 15 to reach the listener at position 20.

<hr>
*PROBLEM:place_all_x_and_y_together* : This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a string consisting of the letters x and y, such as xyxxxyxyy. In addition, you have an operation called flip, which changes a single x to y or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all x's come before all y's. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return 2.
